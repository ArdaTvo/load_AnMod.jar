# load_AnMod.jar
Hello!

If you are trying to install this, press Win + R and type "%appdata%". 
And enter, go to ".minecraft" folder and go to "mods" if you cant see it create a folder named "mods" NO SPACES AND caps !

Move the loadanmod.bat to .minecraft -> mods folder.
And run the loadanmod.bat program but right click and select "run as administrator" and click "yes".

And ready!
